# Built a Team Activity Dashboard - Here's What I Learned About Error Handling

## The Problem
Our team activity page was throwing 500 errors when users hadn't connected their GitHub accounts yet. This created a terrible user experience where the page would crash instead of providing helpful guidance.

## The Solution
Instead of letting the app crash, I implemented graceful error handling that:
- Returns empty data with helpful messages
- Provides direct links to fix integration issues
- Shows informative empty states with actionable guidance
- Maintains 200 status codes for better UX

## Key Learnings
1. **Graceful degradation** is better than hard failures
2. **User guidance** is crucial for onboarding
3. **Empty states** can be opportunities for education
4. **Error messages** should be actionable, not just descriptive

## Code Example
```typescript
// Instead of throwing errors, return helpful responses
return NextResponse.json({
  data: [],
  success: true,
  message: 'GitHub account not connected. Please connect your GitHub account in the integrations page.',
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
});
```

## Frontend Implementation
```tsx
// Show helpful empty state with action button
{activities.length === 0 && (
  <Button variant="outline" asChild>
    <a href="/integrations" className="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300">
      Go to Integrations
    </a>
  </Button>
)}
```

## Discussion
How do you handle integration dependencies in your apps? Do you prefer graceful degradation or strict requirements? What's your approach to onboarding users who haven't set up integrations yet?
